# Team_Randomizer
Program for randomizing teams in a game

This program is designed to randomize certain features in a game called Destiny 2. But with the three different tabs available, this program can be used to randomize teams in any game or sports.
The main tab of the program consists of 4 buttons, namely:
1. Add Players,
2. Remove Player, 
3. Clear All and 
4. Randomize
'Add players' prompts the user for the number of players participating in the activity and the name of each player. After adding the players, all the players will be listed on a player list text area for the user to confirm the player names. 
With the players added, the user can now click on the 'Randomize' button, which takes the list of players and randomly assigns them to either one of the two teams. 
Once the 'Randomize' button is clicked, the players will be split and displayed in a text area below team 1 and 2. 

*Work in Progress* The 'Remove Player' button will remove players from the player list to balance teams and remove players who are not interested.
*Work in Progress* The 'Clear All' button removes all players from the player list to start anew.
*Work in Progress* With the remaining two tabs, one will be used to randomize maps and options relating to maps in the game. While the other tab will used to randomize weapons in the game for the player to use
